A small PCB implementing this circuit by Alan Yates: https://twitter.com/vk2zay/status/716137353278939136

This circuit amplifies, band-pass filters, and envelope detects the signal received from Vive lighthouse base stations. The output is a clean 3.3V pulse. 

It performs a similar function to the off-the-shelf TS3633-CM1 sensor from Triad Semiconductor, but for a fraction of the cost (and the expense of assembly).

The board is populate on both sides and measures 10mm x 16mm.
The photo-diode can either be a through-hole part mounted as shown in the photo below, or a surface-mount part parallel to the board
